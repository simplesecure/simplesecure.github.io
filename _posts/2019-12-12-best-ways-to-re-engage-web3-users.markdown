### Top 5 Re-Engagement Strategies For Blockchain Apps

Are blockchain users different from traditional web users? In a perfect world, no. That perfect world is the one [SimpleID](https://simpleid.xyz){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} is working hard with founders and developers to build. Until then, it's important to apply many of the traditional web's strategies for engaging users but translated to blockchain user specificities. 

We scoured some of the top sources for Web 2.0 strategies on user engagement and adjusted those tips and tricks into blockchain-specific approaches. We'll take a look at the top-five strategies for re-engaging blockchain users, but before we do, let's make sure we understand what re-engagement is. Or, better yet, let's define what engagement and re-engagement is NOT: 

> Lots of signups doesnâ€™t translate to lots of customers. Customers are the result of a series of events.
-[Intercom Blog](https://www.intercom.com/blog/ways-to-increase-user-engagement/){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} 

Getting users to sign up is great, but it doesn't equal engagement. Engagement varies from app to app, but the principle is universal. Engagement means people like interacting with your application, are happy to come back, and want to tell their friends and family. 

If you're not yet focusing on what to do after your users have left your app, you're not alone. The blockchain application space has lagged behind in this regard, and for good reason. Decentralization is about user ownership and privacy. We don't want to replicate the models of the old web. But there are now ways (including using SimpleID) to re-engage your users after they've left your app without infringing on the core benefits that blockchain apps provide. 

With that in mind, let's explore the top-five re-engagement strategies for blockchain users. 

### 1. Share Their Content  

Hubspot, one of the top resources for Web 2.0 engagement and customer management, [suggests that](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/re-engage-your-customers){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} sharing user content on social media is one of the best ways to re-engage users. We agree, but you can and should take this a step further in the blockchain world. 

Blockchain users tend to be social creatures. They hang on on Telegram and Discord. They like to talk about similar interests. If you see content from your users that can benefit the rest of your user base, definitely share it on social media. But you can also include it in a message to the customers who would benefit from that content most. Using segmenting tools, you can build a list of users of your app that fit the criteria you defined, then you can write a personalized email that shares the wonderful content another user has already put out there. It gives that one user a boost and it helps a larger chunk of your own internal community (your customers).

### 2. Tell Them What They're Missing  

Chargify, a payment processing company, writes often about customer experience and how to win (and keep winning) users. [They suggest](https://www.chargify.com/blog/how-to-re-engage-unengaged-users-before-they-cancel/){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} sending an email is one of the best ways to re-engage a user before they've churned. Churning is the point at which the user is not coming back and you've just lost the chance to increase or even maintain your active user count. The email you send matters, though. In the blockchain application world, the utility of the app is often very different from traditional apps. Showcase that. Tell your users what's new. Got a new collectible on your blockchain marketplace? Email about it. Listing a new asset class on your decentralized exchange? Social media announcements aren't enough. Send an email. Notice other users doing something really interesting with your product? Share that with users who have not used the product in some time. Email matters, but make sure the messaging counts. 

### 3. Engage Them Before They've Stopped Engaging

Intercom, a customer messaging platform for the traditional web, [suggests that](https://www.intercom.com/blog/churn-retention-and-reengaging-customers/){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} the best indicator of a user who is about to churn is activity churn. Activity churn means the gradual (or sudden) reduction in activity within your product. In the blockchain space, this type of activity likely means a reduction in transactions, specifically transactions against a smart contract you may have deployed. Using tools like what SimpleID provides, you can segment users who have not interacted with your contract within a certain time period and send them an email. Per the second tip above, you just have to make sure that email has a clear purpose and good messaging. 

### 4. Segment With Purpose

Campaign Monitor, an email marketing platform [suggests that](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/03/using-email-marketing-to-re-engage-your-app-users/){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"}{:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} one of the best tools for re-engagement is grouping your "problem" customers. While I'm not going to go so far as to say a user that needs to be re-engaged is a problem customer (the problem is yours, not theirs after all), I will say that segmenting your user pool properly is important. For blockchain users, this can mean filtering by a variety of interesting metrics. For example, if a new competitor comes into the market and you know the smart contract address they use for their application, you could create a user pool of your customers that have also used the competitor's product. This is the beauty of blockchain data. It's public, transparent, and SimpleID makes it easy to turn into insightful user segmenting. 

### 5. Be Social

Customer.io, a customer relationship manager, [says that](https://customer.io/blog/triggered-engagement-email-campaigns/){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"} using social proof is a great way to re-engage users who haven't been active on your application. This generally means providing proof that other people in the user's same community are loving your product. In the Web 2.0 world, this often means taking testimonials from social media or quotes, but you can do more with blockchain data. Using SimpleID, you can analyze a variety of on-chain transactions to build a profile of social activity. You can tell your users exactly how many other people have bought a collectible in the same category, invested in an asset with a similar return, or any number of other combinations. This type of social data is powerful in encouraging people to come back. 

#### Conclusion

We will see a convergence of traditional web user behaviors with blockchain user behaviors. Until that happens, though, it's important to implement engagement strategies targeted toward the people who are actually using your application. These tips should help, but SimpleID can help further. [Explore our solutions today](https://simpleid.xyz){:target="_blank:rel="noopener no referrer"}.
